The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug
-----------------------------------

I chose this site because I aspire to create sites like this eventually. It was interesting to see how it functioned,
what happened without the styling and how much of it was what as it relates to the web stack.

This is how it broke down:

	1. The site was not a responsive design. If you changed the browser size the site did not change with this
	   adjustment.
	2. Turn off all styles and the site became very broken:
		* Cloud, map, middle-earth location name and the opening title images are individual images and sections
		  of images, and way down on the now very long and basic page
		* There's huge black and white pixelated "images" that are randomly through out the long page, but you can't
		  always figure out what they are or what they did before turning off the styles
		* The text and lines are scattered throughout the page oddly and in basic html format depending on how they
		  were tagged
		* Large areas of white nothing
		* Upshot: The music still works!
	3. Turn off javaScript: black screen, no site basically
	4. Web Stack:
		* HTML: the HTML is there but it doesn't provide much of a site at this level in the stack. It has to have
		  the styling and javaScript to function
		* CSS: The CSS creates the layered, 3D look and feel of the site. Without it the site's presentation falls
		  apart and is pretty unusable
		* JavaScript: This site relies heavily on javaScript. There is no site without it. As in it stops at a black
		  screen...of Smaug's deathly throat possibly?
		* Flash: none

The site in its full glory is an amazing creation and environment as you enter further into it. The music, artwork,
animation, use of parallax create a true work of art in my oppinion. It really draws the user into it and encourages
interaction and activity throughout the site. It does adapt to the individual person using it through inter-site games
and interactions. Not sure how it will gracefully change over time, or if it will.
